> **Disclaimer:** While AutoModpack is a powerful tool for managing modpacks, the content it downloads (mods, resource packs, etc.) is created by various talented developers. Please remember to respect their work and licenses. Don't use AutoModpack to mass-distribute content without explicit permission, especially for commercial purposes. Always check the licenses of the mods you include in your pack.

## üî• Why AutoModpack is Your New Best Friend

This isn't just another mod; it's a game-changer for private servers. Here's why:

*   üîå **Plug-'n'-Play:** Install the mod, and you're done! Live in perfect sync with the server's modpack forever.
*   üîÑ **Seamless Player Updates:** Players get the latest modpack updates automatically, without manual downloads or disruptions.
*   üöÄ **Effortless Admin Management:** Easily manage mods, configs, resource packs, shaders, and more. Your modpack, your control.
*   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Direct & Respectful Downloads:** The mod pulls directly from Modrinth and CurseForge APIs, so mod authors get credit for every download.
*   üîí **Secure & Speed:** Encrypted, authorized, compressed, quick modpack downloads.

## üõ†Ô∏è How the Magic Happens

AutoModpack works by generating a modpack (**metadata file**) on the server, containing all the files of your modpack. The server then hosts this file and the modpack files.

When a client connects to server (simplified):

1.  AutoModpack securely connects to the modpack host server and fetches the metadata.
2.  It uses Modrinth and CurseForge APIs to download directly your modpack's files where possible.
3.  All files are downloaded to the client's automodpack folder.
4.  Restart the game, AutoModpack loads the modpack and the client is perfectly synced and ready to play!

On subsequent game boots, AutoModpack checks for updates. If changes are detected, it updates the modpack in the background, no additional restarts required!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security and Trust - Read This!

> With great power comes great responsibility.

Because it downloads files directly into your game folder, it's crucial to **only use it on servers you absolutely trust**. A malicious server (administrator) *can* include harmful files.

While AutoModpack itself tries to be as secure as possible, due to the nature of the internet, the creators and contributors of AutoModpack are not responsible for any harm, damage, loss, or issues that may result from files downloaded from a server you connect to using the mod. **By using AutoModpack, you acknowledge and accept this risk.**

**If you have valuable security insights or concerns, please reach out!** You can contact privately on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/464522287618457631) or open an issue on GitHub.
## üöÄ Getting Started is a Breeze!

Installing AutoModpack is as simple as installing any other mod.

1.  Download the AutoModpack from the releases page on [GitHub](https://github.com/Skidamek/AutoModpack/releases), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/automodpack), or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/automodpack).
2.  Place the downloaded file into the `/mods/` folder of both your server and client Minecraft installations.

That's typically all you need to do! AutoModpack will automatically create the modpack from your server's mods.

**Want to customize your modpack further?** Add configs, client-side-only mods, and more? **Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Skidamek/AutoModpack/wiki)!** It *hopefully* has all the details you need to tailor AutoModpack to your specific needs.

Prefer an all-in-one solution? You can also use our [modified Fabric installer](https://github.com/Skidamek/AutoModpack-Installer/releases/tag/Latest) which downloads AutoModpack alongside the Fabric loader.

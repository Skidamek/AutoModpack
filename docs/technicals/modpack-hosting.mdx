By default AutoModpack hosts your modpack on your minecraft server port (e.g. 25565). This means that you don't need to open any other port on your router/firewall.
If you want to use different port, disable `hostModpackOnMinecraftPort` and change `hostPort` in [config](../configuration/server-config).

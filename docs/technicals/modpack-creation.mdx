**Yes, you can add *anything* to your modpack.**

#### Two ways of adding content to the modpack.

- To re-use already existing files on server use `syncedFiles` read more in [config](../configuration/server-config). As an example with default config it creates modpack containing *every* mod (file ending with .jar) from server `~/mods/` folder.

- To add more files to modpack use separate directory `~/automodpack/host-modpack/main/`.
For example to add more mods create folder `mods` and place there mods so that will be `~/automodpack/host-modpack/main/mods/`**`your-mod.jar`**.
Or to add resourcepacks analogically create folder `resourcepacks` and place there resourcepacks so that will be `~/automodpack/host-modpack/main/resourcepacks/`**`your-resourcepack.zip`**.

Do not place in the modpack cache files, like connector's `.connector` directory, its not supposed to be provided within modpack and it break seamless/reboot-less updates.

Both of these methods translate to the `~/.minecraft/` on client side (root directory of minecraft instance).

Remember to regenerate the modpack using `/automodpack generate` (see [commands](../commands/commands))

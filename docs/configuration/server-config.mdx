If enabled, you must manage TLS externally, e.g. on a reverse proxy. When using this option, you have to use different `bindPort` than `-1` and you should consider setting `bindAddress` to a loopback address (e.g. `127.0.0.1`), so the unencrypted traffic between the modpack host and the reverse proxy isn't leaked.                                                                                                                                                     |

## Troubleshooting Config Issues
When finished editing configuration files, make sure to reload them by executing command `automodpack config reload` or restart the server/game.

If you can't find the config files, make sure the client/server was started at least once, so that the files are generated.

If values get restored to default it might mean that your config file is malformed make sure to use editor with JSON parser build-in. Or check in some online one e.g. https://jsonformatter.org/json-parser.

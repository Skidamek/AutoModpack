# AutoModpack Quick Start Guide

So you want to start using AutoModpack? Great! Let's get you started.

> ### For more detailed information:
> - Read the [Modpack Creation page](technicals/modpack-creation) to learn how to manage your modpack
> - Read the [Configuration page](configuration/server-config) to learn how to customize AutoModpack for your needs

## Installation

1. **Download AutoModpack**: Get the latest version of AutoModpack for your Minecraft version from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/automodpack) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/automodpack)
2. **Install AutoModpack**: Place the downloaded mod into your `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance
3. **Start your server**: Launch your Minecraft server with AutoModpack installed. This will generate the initial modpack metadata

> #### It is recommended to connect to your server with just AutoModpack installed on the client first to ensure everything works.

## First Connection

On first connection, you will be prompted to verify the server's certificate fingerprint. This ensures you are connecting to the correct server and not a malicious one. Read more about [certificate verification](technicals/certificate).

After verification, AutoModpack will ask you to confirm the modpack installation. Confirm it, and the modpack will download and install automatically.

Restart your game. Your server's modpack should now be loaded, and you should be able to connect, spawning in the overworld.

> #### **Note:** If you don't see your modpack mods in the `mods` folder, they are installed in `~/.minecraft/automodpack/modpacks/{your-modpack}/mods/`. This is intentional to keep mod updates clean.

## Server Setup & Configuration

### Server Config File

**Location:** `~/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

**Example Configuration:**
```json
{
  "modpackHost": true,
  "generateModpackOnStart": true,
  "syncedFiles": [
    "/mods/*.jar",
    "/resourcepacks/*",
    "/config/**",
    "/shaderpacks/*",
    "!/config/fancymenu/user_variables.db"
  ],
  "allowEditsInFiles": [
    "/options.txt"
  ],
  "forceCopyFilesToStandardLocation": [],
  "autoExcludeServerSideMods": true,
  "requireAutoModpackOnClient": true
}
```

**Key Configuration Options:**

- **`syncedFiles`**: List of files and folders to sync to clients. Use `*` for wildcards and `**` for recursive matching. Prefix with `!` to exclude
- **`allowEditsInFiles`**: Files that clients can edit locally. These files are downloaded once and not updated automatically
  - **Example:** To always update FancyMenu configs, remove `/config/**` from `allowEditsInFiles`
  - **⚠️ Warning:** Removing `/config/**` will make ALL config files non-editable. If you only want specific config folders to be always updated, use exclusions instead:
    ```json
    "syncedFiles": [
      "/config/**"
    ],
    "allowEditsInFiles": [
      "/config/**",
      "!/config/fancymenu/**"
    ]
    ```
- **`forceCopyFilesToStandardLocation`**: Use with caution. Forces files to be copied to the standard Minecraft folders (breaks seamless updates)
- **Other options**: See the [full configuration page](configuration/server-config) for detailed explanations of all settings

### Splitting Mods for Server and Client

- **Client-side mods**: Place in `~/automodpack/host-modpack/main/mods` (e.g., visual enhancements)
- **Server-side mods (synced)**: Place in the standard `mods` folder; they will be synced to clients
- **Excluding server-only mods example**:
  ```json
  "syncedFiles": [
    "/mods/*.jar",
    "!/mods/lithostitched-fabric*.jar"
  ]
  ```

## Client Setup & Configuration

AutoModpack automatically manages client configuration. When you connect to a server, AutoModpack will:

- Download the modpack (mods, configs, resource packs, etc.) to `~/.minecraft/automodpack/modpacks/{modpack}/`
- Prompt you to verify the server's certificate fingerprint (first time only)
- Ask for confirmation to install the modpack

After installation, restart Minecraft to load the modpack.

> #### **Note:** For advanced configuration, see the [client config page](configuration/client-config).

---

## Maintaining Updates

- Files listed in `allowEditsInFiles` are only downloaded once and not updated. Use this for files that players should be able to customize
- For files that must always be in sync (e.g., specific configs), ensure they are in `syncedFiles` and not in `allowEditsInFiles`

**Example for FancyMenu configs:**
```json
"syncedFiles": [
  "/config/fancymenu/**"
],
"allowEditsInFiles": [
  "/options.txt"
]
```

This ensures FancyMenu configs are always updated, while players can still edit their options.

## Troubleshooting

> #### **Important:**
> - Ensure the same version of AutoModpack is used on both server and client
> - Make sure your server runs and is accessible without AutoModpack
> - Check server logs for hints
> - Read the [FAQ page](faq) for common questions
